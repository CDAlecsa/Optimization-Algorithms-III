# Optimization-Algorithms-III
- optimizers for 1D and 2D objective functions (including Rosenbrock function). A comparison based upon the energy dissipation, phase portrait, decrease in the objective function
- this repository is based on the paper 'Asymptotic behaviour of a Strang splitting scheme for damped second-order gradient systems' 
by Cristian Daniel Alecsa, Titus Pinta & Adrian Viorel

- the optimization algorithms are presented in the attached '.pdf' file
- one cand modify the input parameters in the '.txt' file (in both folders)

Optimization Algorithms :
- Crank Nicolson (implicit method)
- Heun Method (explicit method)
- Strang Splitting (implicit method)
- Strang Splitting with Predictor-Corrector (explicit method)
- Polyak method (explicit method)
- Runge Kutta integrator


The '.mw' files are made in Maple. These files contain the integrals from the RHS of the Strang splitting and Strang with Predictor-Corrector (for the 1D objective function) and the exact solution for the linear system of ODE's (in the 2D folder).
